The goal of this project was to create an LCD-style clock
- Digit color is changeable by a long press gesture
- Background color is changeable by swipe gesture
- Time zone and 24hr/12hr are selectable (The time zone city names are some of the more obscure places I've lived)
- All user preferences are saved using NSUserDefaults
- The clock is displayed properly on different devices even when the device is rotated (using AutoLayout)
- Time changes are triggered using NSTimer

## Requirements

- iOS 8.0+ / Mac OS X 10.9+
